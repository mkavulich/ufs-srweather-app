    """
    This function reads the dictionary showing the location of a given experiment, runs a
    `rocotorun` command to update the experiment (running new jobs and updating the status of
    previously submitted ones), and reads the rocoto database file to update the status of
    each job for that experiment in the experiment dictionary.

    The function then and uses a simple set of rules to combine the statuses of every task
    into a useful "status" for the whole experiment, and returns the updated experiment dictionary.

    Experiment "status" levels explained:
    CREATED: The experiments have been created, but the monitor script has not yet processed them.
             This is immediately overwritten at the beginning of the "monitor_jobs" function, so we
             should never see this status in this function. Including just for completeness sake.
    SUBMITTING: All jobs are in status SUBMITTING or SUCCEEDED. This is a normal state; we will 
             continue to monitor this experiment.
    DYING:   One or more tasks have died (status "DEAD"), so this experiment has had an error.
             We will continue to monitor this experiment until all tasks are either status DEAD or
             status SUCCEEDED (see next entry).
    DEAD:    One or more tasks are at status DEAD, and the rest are either DEAD or SUCCEEDED. We
             will no longer monitor this experiment.
    ERROR:   One or more tasks are at status UNKNOWN, meaning that rocoto has failed to track the
             job associated with that task. This will require manual intervention to solve, so we
             will no longer monitor this experiment.
             This status may also appear if we fail to read the rocoto database file.
    RUNNING: One or more jobs are at status RUNNING, and the rest are either status QUEUED, SUBMITTED,
             or SUCCEEDED. This is a normal state; we will continue to monitor this experiment.
    QUEUED:  One or more jobs are at status QUEUED, and some others may be at status SUBMITTED or
             SUCCEEDED.
             This is a normal state; we will continue to monitor this experiment.
    SUCCEEDED: All jobs are status SUCCEEDED; we will monitor for one more cycle in case there are
             unsubmitted jobs remaining.
    COMPLETE:All jobs are status SUCCEEDED, and we have monitored this job for an additional cycle
             to ensure there are no un-submitted jobs. We will no longer monitor this experiment.

    Args:
        expt    (dict):    A dictionary containing the information for an individual experiment, as
                           described in the main monitor_jobs() function.
        name     (str):    Name of the experiment; used for logging only
        refresh (bool):    If true, this flag will check an experiment status even if it is listed
                           as DEAD, ERROR, or COMPLETE. Used for initial checks for experiments
                           that may have been restarted.
