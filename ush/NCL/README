This script generates a 2-D color plot of one or more of the tiles on
a cubed-sphere grid on top of a map of the continents.  Each tile is
depicted in the output graphics file as a uniformly colored region.

An example of a call to this script from the command line is as fol-
lows:

  ncl -n plot_fields.ncl \
      'help=False' \
      'grid_dir="./some_dir/grid"' \
      'input_file="nggps2d.nc"' \
      'fields="u1000"' \
      'res=96' \
      'tile_inds=(/1,2,3/)' \
      'draw_tile_bdy=True' \
      'draw_tile_grid=True' \
      'draw_RAP_domain=True' \
      'RAP_grid_fn="./some_dir/RAP_grid.nc"' \
      'draw_RAP_bdy=True' \
      'draw_RAP_grid=True' \
      'map_proj="cyln"' \
      'map_proj_ctr=(/0,90/)' \
      'subreg=(/-30,30,-25,25/)' \
      'graphics_type="ncgm"'

The output is a graphics file named

  C[res]_grid.[ext]

where res is the specified resolution and ext is the graphics file ex-
tension (determined by the specified output graphics type graphics_-
type).  The input arguments to this script are:

help:
This argument specifies whether or not to print out the documentation
for this script and exit.  It is either True or False.  Default is
False.  If this is set to True, this script prints out the documenta-
tion and exits, ignoring all other arguments.  To see the documenta-
tion, type "ncl plot_fields.ncl 'help=True'" on the command line in the
directory of this script.

grid_dir:
This argument specifies the directory in which the grid files are lo-
cated.  It is assumed that these are NetCDF files with names of the
form

   C[res]_grid.tile[N].nc

where res is the resolution specified on the command line and N is the
tile number.  The tile numbers to consider are specified by the input
argument tile_inds (see below).  Default value is the current directo-
ry, i.e. "./".

input_file:
This argument specifies the file that contains the fields to be plotted.
It can be any of the FV3 output files that are typically named nggps2d.nc,
nggps3d_4xdaily.nc, atmos_4xdaily.nc, atmos_static.nc, etc.

fields:
This argument specifies the fields from the input_file that will be plotted.

nlev:
Index of vertical (presssure) level to plot.

fcst_index:
Forecast index to plot.

res:
This argument specifies the cubed-sphere resolution, i.e. the number
of cells in each of the two horizontal directions on each of the 6
tiles of the global cubed-sphere grid.  Valid values are: 48, 96, 192,
384, 768, 1152, and 3072.

tile_inds:
This argument specifies the indices of those tiles on the cubed-sphere
grid that are to be plotted.  For example, to plot tiles 1, 3, and 5, 
specify

  tile_inds = (/ 1, 3, 5 /)

If this is not specified, all available tiles are plotted (where by 
"available", we mean all tiles for which there exists a grid file in
grid_dir).

draw_tile_bdy:
This argument specifies whether or not to draw the boundary of each 
specified tile.  It is either True or False.  Default is True.

draw_tile_grid:
This argument specifies whether or not to draw the boundaries of all
grid cells on each tile that is being plotted.  It is either True or 
False.  Default is False.  For a high-resolution grid, this can make
it difficult to see the underlying color of the tile in the output
graphics file (because there would be many grid lines drawn very close
together).

draw_RAP_domain:
This argument specifies whether or not to draw the original [i.e. pre-
FV3 RAP (RAPid Refresh) domain].  It is either True or False.  Default
is False.  If this is set to True, the RAP domain is added to the plot
as a uniformly colored region (with a color that is different from any
of the cubed-sphere tiles).

RAP_grid_fn:
This argument specifies the full (i.e. including directory) file name
of the NetCDF file that describes the RAP grid.  This is used only if
draw_RAP_domain is set to True.

draw_RAP_bdy:
This argument specifies whether or not to draw the boundary of the RAP
domain.  It is either True or False.  Default is True.  This has no
effect if draw_RAP_domain is set to False.

draw_RAP_grid:
This argument specifies whether or not to draw the boundaries of all
grid cells on the RAP domain.  It is either True or False.  Default is
False.  For a high-resolution RAP grid, setting this to True can make
it difficult to see the underlying color of the RAP domain in the out-
put graphics file (because there would be many grid lines drawn very
close together.  This has no effect if draw_RAP_domain is set to
False.

map_proj:
This argument specifies the map projection to use for the plot.  Valid
values are:

  "cyln" - for cylindrical-equidistant projection
  "ortho" - for orthographic (i.e. on a sphere) projection
  "lamb" - for Lambert equal-area projection

If this argument is omitted, a cylindrical-equidistant projection is
used.  

map_proj_ctr:
This argument specifies the point on the sphere at which to center the
map projection used for the plot.  It consists of the point's longi-
tude and latitude (in degrees), as follows:

  map_proj_ctr = (/ 30, 40 /)

If this is not specified, it is set to (/0,0/) for the cylindrical-
equidistant and orthographic (i.e. on a sphere) projections and to
(/0,90/) (i.e. the North Pole) for the Lambert equal-area projection.

subreg:
If using a cylindrical-equidistant map projection, this argument spe-
cifies the minimum and maximum longitudes and latitudes (in degrees)
of the subregion to plot.  It has the format

  subreg = (/ lon_min, lon_max, lat_min, lat_max /)

where lon_min and lon_max are the minimum and maximum values of the
longitude and lat_min and lat_max are the minimum and maximum values
of the latitude.  If this arbument is omitted, the field is plotted on
the whole globe.  It is ignored for projections other than cylindri-
cal-equidistant.

graphics_type:
This argument specifies the type of graphics file to generate as out-
put.  It can be either "ncgm" (NCAR Graphics) or "png".  Default is
"ncgm".
